I share this source code under MIT License.

## Used languages and technologies:
* HTML
* CSS (SASS)
* JavaScript (ES2015+ syntax)
* PHP (only for localisation purposes)

## Used tools:
* NPM (dependency management)
* Webpack (bundling assets)
* Babel (JS transpilling)
* ESLint (code linting)
* Image optimization plugins and CSS/JS minifiers (performance matters)
* SASS parser
* Livereload plugin (development purposes)
* Fontello font generator
* RealFaviconGenerator
* Easing function generator by Timothee Groleau
* Some other tools, such as autoprefixer and various Webpack loaders

## Used methodologies and conventions:
* I tried to follow BEM methodology for the HTML/CSS naming conventions in order to create more readable, scalable and reusable components.
* I was consistent about using certain formatting rules (you can find more details in ESLint configuration files) and some popular design patterns
* Progressive enhancement - website is made to be fully readable regardless of circumstances (such as no-images, no-stylesheet or no-javascript modes)
* Responsive web design - website is made to fit any screen resolution
* Accessibility - website should be fully accessible by screen reader’s users (any reported accessibility issues would be appreciated)
* W3C standards - I tried to follow newest W3C recommendations (with a few exceptions, eg. regarding definition lists)

## Used third-party libraries and add-ons:
* Fontawesome, Bebas Neue, Playfair Display and Nunito fonts
* Normalize.css by Nicolas Gallagher
* CSS Particle effect based on Robin Selmer’s code

## Other features:
* This source includes my own animation library based on requestAnimationFrame technique which I intend to develop and separate from this project in the future.
* Most HTML, CSS, and JS code (all except for what’s mentioned above) was created from scratch, without any plugins and libraries.
